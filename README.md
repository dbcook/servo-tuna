# servo-tuna - Servo tuning app for USB-serial connected motors

__CAVEAT__ This is WIP and doesn't do anything useful yet!

This is an embryonic try at creating a cross-platform Node/React based app for tuning USB-serial connected servos.

The initial target is the
[StepperOnline iSV57T](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/nema-23-integrated-easy-servo-motor-90w-3000rpm-0-3nm-42-49oz-in-20-50vdc-brushless-dc-servo-motor-isv57t-090)
series of servos.

## Project Status

*RESEARCHING*

The current issue is to find a serial port library for node.js apps that has sufficient features
to robustly run proper serial protocols asynchronously, and that
will run inside all major Node frameworks (Electron, next.js, etc).

[The Mozilla Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) is of interest.
It's pretty new (still shown as experimental) and specifically claims to handle the control lines and port closure properly.
So far it's only built into Chrome, Edge and Opera browsers and requires that
you are using HTTPS but that's probably good enough.  Using these built-in APIs will eliminate all problems
with binary paths under webpack.  Experiments to ensue.

One candidate library that still gets mentioned quite a bit has been ruled out - see details under "Things that Don't Work".

## Motivation

The StepperOnline iSV57T NEMA 23 servos are very inexpensive ($100 price point) servos with stepper-compataible pulse/dir control and high resolution 32K encoders.
This makes them conceptually very attractive for a number of DIY applications including CNC machine conversions, telescope mount drives, etc.

However the [tuning app](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/index.php?route=product/product/get_file&file=1361/iSV-T_software.zip) provided by StepperOnline is execrable.

* Windows-only
* Many parameters completely undocumented
* Unhelpful guess-the-port serial port connection UI
* Badly translated help text and error messages
* Poor graph interface with totally antique controls, no sliders, etc.
* Doesn't follow conventional terminology for PID control
* Auto-tune features ineffective for the telescope use case

## Goals

* Cross-platform app using Node.js (via the next.js framework), React UI components, and the Web Serial APIÃŸ.
* Reverse engineer the serial protocol for the iSV57T servos.
* Help selecting the correct serial port
* Much more intuitive UI
* Useful embedded help
* Effective wide-range auto-tuning with frequency response analysis
* Drastically improved performance graph functionality and automation
* Extendable to other serial port configured servos like ClearPath, DMM, etc.

## Possible Limitations

* The serial port programming interface on the servos may not offer sufficient motion support
  for comprehensive auto-tuning.  Needs exploration.
* The tuning program thus might benefit from having some adjunct hardware that can work
  as a pulse function generator.  Need rates up to 300KHz to fully exercise the servos.
  Doing the function generation directly would imply a pretty fast MCU like a Teensy 4.1.
  Perhaps easier to do it with a programmable 2-channel (pulse/dir) function generator like the ones from
  Rigol and Siglent.
* Yet another idea would be to implement the function generation in OnStepX, which already has
  pulse generation code and a WiFi command interface.

## Framework Elements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

[React UI Components](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

[Next.js Framework](https://nextjs.org/)

[Mozilla Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API)

## Things that Don't Work

[Node SerialPort](https://serialport.io/) - REJECTED

I've determined that the [standalone serialport node library](https://serialport.io/)
is not suitable for this application.  Although it's been around for 10+ years, it
lacks various crucial design features:

1. There's no provision for full control of the HW flow control lines on all platforms
   (essential for programming Arduino devices and for some embedded targets)
2. No clean method for terminating async read calls when the port is closed; prevents
   the node process from exiting and may leak resources.
3. Does not detect when it's executing in the browser where serial port access isn't allowed
4. Can't find its architecture specific prebuilt libraries when webpack'd at
   runtime by next.js (see following explanation)

The serialport prebuilds tree needs to be found in the directory from where the Node server runs.
For a nextjs app, this is ./.next/server
This is because of how node_modules/node-gyp-build/node-gyp-build.js resolves paths.
However, .next/server gets completely wiped out everytime you do 'npm run dev', so you
can't implant the prebuilts beforehand.

In addition, the serialport project looks quite moribund, with 130+ open issues and no recent
commit activity by anything except renovate-bot.  Some serious issues over a year old have
no human responses.  Basically it's dead unless you can tolerate low functionality and a
lot of headaches.

## Other Resources

[Serial Port Monitor for Windows](https://www.com-port-monitoring.com/)

Recent Reddit posts indicate this is likely the best available monitor for sniffing
USBSerial traffic between a 3rd party app and an external device on a Windows host.
You need the $99 pro version for this capability.  This monitor is needed for
reverse engineering the Stepperonline protocol.

## Setup

### Initial Setup
```
brew install npm  # if needed
# git clone servo-tuna and cd into that dir...
# install react, react-dom, next.js
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
# npm install serialport  # deprecated, need replacement!
# npm install child_process # needed by serialport
```

### Resetting Dependencies

`npm install` manipulates package-lock.json in ways that can cause trouble.  `npm ci` is less destructive.
See [discussion here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48524417/should-the-package-lock-json-file-be-added-to-gitignore)

There is some controversy about whether package-lock.json should be gitignore'd but the majority opinion
seems to be that it should be checked into github.

To reset everything (this is reasonably quick):

1. wipe out node_modules with `rm -rf ./node_modules`
2. remove `package-lock.json` or erase all its contents
3. wipe out the `dependencies` entry in `package.json`
4. re-do the `npm install` operations as given above

## Execute


```
npm run dev
# in browser go to localhost:3000
```
